  StoryText: 'You run down the stairs hoping the exit is not locked. With each step
    you realize that your enthusiasm about legs was premature. Their strength is fading
    at an alarming rate.

    But you endure and you continue until you see a sign "First floor." Enter, locate
    exit. Exit is not locked. Relief. Open it and realize it is winter, snowstorm,
    low visibility, freezing cold. You barely have any clothes on you.


    What future holds for you is unknown. Freezing to death is the most likely outcome.
    You will go as far as you can but cold will devour your strength. It will be cold,
    very cold, until cold becomes warm and puts you to sleep. Eternal sleep...'
