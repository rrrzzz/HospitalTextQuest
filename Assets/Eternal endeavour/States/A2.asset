  StoryText: "You lie down, close the eyes and focus on the soothing humming of the
    machinery. You envision that it gently flows through your ears and into the body
    and mind washing away all the pain and sorrow. All you need to do now is get a
    hold of this flow and let it lull you to restful sleep. A few minutes pass and
    you start feeling something akin to a dark alien presence. You know this presence
    too well and try not to pay any attention to it because the more you do the faster
    it will expand. \r\nAnother few minutes pass and despite your efforts a venomous
    flower of pain starts blossoming inside the chest. Its abominable tendrils reach
    into the deepest pits of your psyche, piercing it with their thorns. Initially
    it is a raw experience of psychological pain but soon it starts attracting all
    kinds of unpleasant thoughts. What your life could have been if not for this fucking
    disease. What you could have done to prevent it during early onset. Shouldn\u2019t
    you just end it all and stop this never-ending agony? As always, this whirlwind
    of regrets and what-ifs makes the pain even worse. \r\nAnd then comes the best
    part: the physical pain in your spine and the psychological pain intertwine. There
    is no telling now where one ends and another begins. They feed on each other and
    grow, grow, grow making it impossible for you to think of anything else but your
    misery and suffering."
