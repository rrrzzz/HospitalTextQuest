  StoryText: "\u201CI know it\u2019s hard, believe I do. But we didn\u2019t hide any
    information from you during your first visit. We said that it will take at least
    half a year to see any improvements in a difficult case like yours. Trust is the
    key here. You got to think positive and don\u2019t let any doubts undermine your
    emotional state. I understand that it\u2019s easier said than done but you have
    to remember that we are here for you and we are doing everything we can to cure
    this vicious disease.\u201D Doctor smiles gently.\r\nThis smile of his showing
    up again and again starts looking a bit fake. Oh well, I guess he has seen dozens
    if not hundreds of patients like me and it must be hard to genuinely invest emotions
    every time. At least he is trying."
