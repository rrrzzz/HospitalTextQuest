  StoryText: "As you are about to approach the door to your ward you suddenly have
    a horrible premonition. You recognize the place but looks like it was abandoned
    a long time ago. There is dust everywhere and even cobwebs in some corners. At
    first you think it\u2019s your familiar inner demons rearing their ugly heads
    but the feeling is somehow different this time around."
  FirstChoice: Calm yourself down. There is no need to make your despair and anxiety
    even worse. And there is no reason not to trust your doctor. Without janitors
    any public space becomes dirty in a matter of days.
  SecondChoice: Muster all your strength and power of will. Try to remain as alert
    as you can, and prepare for the worst.
