  StoryText: "Despite horrible pain you smile blissfully, it seems like you have never
    felt this good before. The dark embrace of death doesn\u2019t seem like something
    to be afraid of. On the contrary it is as if the primordial mother welcomes you
    into her loving arms. There is no explanation to it but somehow you are absolutely
    certain that the Darkness will turn into its complete opposite in the next moment.
    It will become a shining, all-encompassing light which will pierce and cleanse
    each and every atom in your body, mind and soul making them one with this unbearable
    eternal light. There is no object and subject anymore. There is no I and non-I.
    There is nothing, the absolute Void, the absolute Wholeness.\n\nA wise choice,
    a wise choice indeed... "
