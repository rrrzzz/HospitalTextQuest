  StoryText: "Upon waking up you realize that you are unable to move not only your
    legs but even your hands. At first you think that this is the result of disease
    worsening but soon realize that your hands are tied to the bed with leather handcuffs
    usually used to prevent psychotic patients in psychiatric wards harming themselves.\r\nYou\u2019re
    confused and while you are gathering your thoughts the doctor comes in. \r\nThere
    is not even a trace of his warm smile. Now his face is distorted by a lustful
    grin.  \r\n\nIn a sudden flash you realize the grim reality of your conditions
    to the minutest details. Most likely the hospital was abandoned weeks if not
    months ago. The doctor took a particular liking to your face and body. \nThe
    doctor makes you his personal fucktoy. Your paralysis deteriorates which makes
    any form of resistance totally futile. The only thing you wish for now is death
    but you have at least 40 years ahead of you. You should have killed yourself
    when you had that chance. But it's too late now."
