  StoryText: "The doctor dodges, kicks it out of your hand and easily puts your weakened
    body into straightjacket. As soon as he manages to stuff you inside there is
    a feeling that something is not right with this jacket. Shortly after you realize
    that there are two accurate incisions: one in the front of your crotch and one
    in the back. Resourceful doctor killed two birds with one stone. He restricted
    your movements and got a convenient access to both of your lower holes at the
    same time.\r\n- \u201CYou\u2019ve got the spirit girl! I like that but I think
    we need to make you a little bit more docile so all the procedures are cancelled
    from now on. Meaning of course that the lower part of your body will become completely
    paralyzed and who knows what else...\u201D - A brief sinister grin distorts the
    outline of his mouth \u2013 \u201CIf you don\u2019t want to make already tiny
    chances to walk again even smaller I strongly suggest to reconsider your attitude.
    And now I am going to give you some time to think. Use it wisely.\u201D\r\nHe
    throws your body into the bed and promptly leaves humming a merry tune.\r\n"
