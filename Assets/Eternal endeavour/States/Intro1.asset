  StoryText: "You wake up in an empty ward and try to recollect your thoughts. The
    last six months haven't been easy for you. It all started one ordinary evening
    when you felt unusual dizzyness and had to go to bed early. As more days passed
    your condition only deteriorated. You started having problems with memory, concentration
    and eventually even moving your limbs. Diagnosed with a rare neurodegenerative
    disease you were admitted to St. Abraxas Hospital to undergo an experimental
    treatment. \n\nThe procedure is far from pleasant: your spinal cord is fixated
    and several needles penetrate your spine to inject medicine directly into your
    cerebrospinal fluid. It's a slow and painful process and you have to endure it
    each day. The doctors warned you that it's going to get worse before it gets
    better. But so far things seem to get only worse and worse. Most of the time
    you find yourself in a semiconscious state and have trouble feeling any external
    stimuli besides pain. You lost the count of days long ago. Sometimes it is as
    if the whole week passes in a few minutes and sometimes one hour seems like an
    eternity. You drift in and out of slumber unable to get a firm grasp on reality."
