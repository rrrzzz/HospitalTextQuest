  StoryText: "As the doctor carries you into the ward, you notice something unusual
    about the bed. You try to figure out what it is and then spot the leather handcuffs
    attached to the sides of the bed.\r\n\r\nYou pretend you haven't noticed anything.
    The doctor lays you down gently and begins preparing a syringe filled with a
    sleep aid. While he is focused on his preparations, you concentrate all your
    mental and physical energy, and with a sudden burst, you jump off the bed.\r\n\r\nQuickly,
    you look around for a way out. You spot a trolley with a scalpel lying on it.
    There's also a door, but the doctor is standing close by.\r\n\r\nWhat do you
    do next?\r"
