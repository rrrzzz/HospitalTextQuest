  StoryText: 'Today is nothing different. You feel groggy and your spine is still
    sore from recent punctures. The only difference is an unusual silence. You can
    hear a gentle humming of the machinery used in your treatment but that''s about
    it. No doctors, no other patients. Has this place been deserted and everyone forgot
    about you?


    You look around and decide what to do next:'
  FirstChoice: Get up and explore nearby wards.
  SecondChoice: Try to relax and fall asleep again.
  ThirdChoice: Wait for the doctor who usually shows up shortly after the procedure.
