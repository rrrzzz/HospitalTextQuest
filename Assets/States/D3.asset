  StoryText: "Run to the door. Miraculously your legs are moving and moving swiftly.
    As if the paralysis allowed them to store copious amounts of energy which is bursting
    out as you run. \n\nThe doctor tries to grab you but you dodge. He loses his balance
    and falls on the floor.\n\nYou run through the hall and see the door leading to
    the stairs.\n\nWhat will you do next? \n"
  FirstChoice: Run downstairs to the first floor and exit the building.
  SecondChoice: Run downstairs, enter random floor because you are not sure how long
    your legs will last and maybe there is somebody who can help.
