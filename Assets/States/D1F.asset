  StoryText: "Doctor dodges, kicks it out of your hand, puts you into straightjacket.
    As soon as he manages to stuff you inside there is a feeling that something is
    not right with this jacket. Shortly after you realize that there are two accurate
    incisions: one in the front and one in the back. Resourceful doctor killed two
    birds with one stone. He restricted your movements and got a convenient access
    to both of your holes at the same time.\r\n- \u201CYou\u2019ve got the spirit
    girl! I like that but I think we need to make you a little bit more docile so
    all the procedures are cancelled from now on. Meaning of course that the lower
    part of your body will become completely paralyzed and who knows what else...\u201D
    - A brief sinister grin distorts the outline of his mouth \u2013 \u201CIf you
    don\u2019t want to make already tiny chances to walk again even smaller I strongly
    suggest to reconsider your attitude. And now I am going to give you some time
    to think. Use it wisely.\u201D\r\nHe throws your body into the bed and promptly
    leaves humming a merry tune.\r\n"
