  StoryText: "\u201COkay we should get you to your ward now, there is a comfortable
    bed and all this noise from medical devices won\u2019t bother you,\u201D doctor
    says.  \r\nStrangely there is no wheelchair which he usually brings along but
    he proposes to carry you in his arms. Maybe all of them are in use. 'Whatever
    is the case I don\u2019t have much choice here', you think to yourself and agree.
    He disconnects all the wires, grabs you under the back and knees and puts on
    his shoulder firmly holding you by the thighs. It\u2019s a little awkward that
    somebody touches you there. But he is a professional so you decide not to worry
    about it.\r\n\nAs he carries you through the empty halls you ask the doctor what\u2019s
    wrong with this place and where is everybody? \r\n\u201CRelax, my child, everything
    is fine. We just had a little restructurization and started moving all the personnel
    and patients into a new building. Most of them have already moved but we are
    thinking about the best way to proceed with non-walking patients.\u201D"
