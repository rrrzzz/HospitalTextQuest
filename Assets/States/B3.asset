  StoryText: "\u201CThat is very good! I assure you that an attitude like this can
    work wonders. It may sound strange coming from a medical professional but too
    often it\u2019s the spirit that is really poisoned and all the somatic symptoms
    are just that: symptoms, consequences and complications of original dysfunction.
    We are helping you to cure the body but the spirit is unfortunately beyond the
    reach of modern medicine. So your task is to keep up that attitude, help us help
    you.\u201D Doctor smiles gently.\r\nThis smile of his showing up again and again
    starts looking a bit fake. Oh well, I guess he has seen dozens if not hundreds
    of patients like me and it must be hard to genuinely invest emotions every time.
    At least he is trying.\r"
