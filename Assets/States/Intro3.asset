  StoryText: You lost the count of days long ago. Sometimes it is as if the whole
    week passes in a few minutes and sometimes one hour seems like an eternity. You
    drift in and out of slumber unable to get a firm grasp on reality. Today is nothing
    different. You feel groggy and your spine is still sore from recent punctures.
    The only difference is an unusual silence. You can hear a gentle humming of the
    machinery used in your treatment but that's about it. No doctors, no other patients.
    Has this place been deserted and everyone forgot about you?
