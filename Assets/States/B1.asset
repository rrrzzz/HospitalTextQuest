  StoryText: "\u201CI always say that we\u2019d better not introduce any foreign agents
    to your body unless it\u2019s really necessary. But judging by your condition

    shelves and produces a little phial, takes the cap off, fills a syringe and walks
    to your bed. \u201CIt will sting a little.\u201D \r\nYou don\u2019t feel anything
    being exhausted both physically and emotionally. These drugs usually have delayed
    effect so you will have to wait a little to feel some relief.\r\n"
